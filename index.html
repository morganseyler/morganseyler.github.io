            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my personal website. My name is Morgan Seyler and currently I am enrolled at the University of Oklahoma pursuing my undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems.
                My website contains an about page with general information over who I am, a projects page to display my current and past projects completed through college, and a skill sets page to demonstrate all my potential skills I can bring to a business.

            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to act as a digital portfolio/resume for Morgan Seyler. This website contains detailed information and tangible examples
                of what I can bring to potential future employers.

            <p>
                About me: I was borned and raised in Flower Mound, Texas. I am the oldest of 4 siblings and my parents are Mark and Missy Seyler. For most of my life I have participated in competitive gymnastics
                with a dream of competing on a college gymnastics team. Both of my parents were collegiate gymnastics at the University of Oklahoma which drove me to ultimately making the decision to attend OU in 2018. I achieved a
                spot on the roster which I have been on since. Currently I am a senior and was chosen at the beginning of the 2021 school year to be a captain of the gymnastics team. I plan to finish my undergraduate degree
                in Management Information Systems in fall of 2022.

            <h2>Database</h2>
            <p>This was a group project in which we were tasked with creating a working database in SQL server for a business in the Norman, Oklahoma area. We created ERD diagrams, a complete logical design,
            and a clear explanation as to how we made the database and how it functions.</p>
            <h2>QR Code Generator</h2>
            <p>For this project I used C# to create a working QR code generator. The user can put in any website they wish to output a QR code for.</p>
